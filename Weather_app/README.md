# Weather App

This is a simple app to show weather either in users current location (default) or any city thru search functionality.

App is build using Expo and React Native. Other main components are:

 - openweathermap.org and their API to get weather info
 - mapquestapi.com API to get lat&lon for city thru search
 - App uses device location to get current location. You need to grant permission to enable this to work.
 - UI utilizes components from react-native-elements to have clean and simple elements to build UI
	- Main element used is "Card" so we can show weather info in neat card-element


APP was tested on iPhone Xr using iOS 14.3 and iOS Expo Client version 2.18.2
